I. Introduction

The code in this directory provides a way to split up large files of raw,
binary data into smaller files, or ``chunks'' of data.  It was written
specifically for use with the streaming watershed code contained in the
Examples/StreamedWatershedSegmentation, but can obviously be used in other
contexts.

Vocabulary:  

        volume      - The full data set.  This is either a single file, or, in
                      the case of Visible Human data, a set of slices.

        slice       - A 2d file that is actually one plane out of a 3d volume.

        chunk       - A subset of the full data set.

        to chunk    - The act of splitting the volume into chunks.

        to unchunk  - The act of joining the chunks into a volume.

        header file - A file that contains information about chunks
                      and the volume from which they were created.


Building the code in this directory will produce several executable
utilities.  These executables are driven by parameter files (see documentation
in ../ParameterFileParser).

  catchunkfile header_file_name
        Prints the contents of a header file used by the other various
        utilities.

  chunker parameter_file_name 
        Chunks a standard raw binary volume.

  vhchunker parameter_file_name
        Chunks a Visible Human color data format raw binary volume.

  vhunchunker parameter_file_name
        Unchunks any set of chunks into either a single volume, or a set of
        slices.
