\begin{abstract}
\noindent This example demonstrates how to create a geometrical shape within an itkImage
using Spatial Functions. Specifically, this example will create an itkImage consisting of an
ellipsoid using the itkEllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunction found in the Insight
\module{functions} module.

\section{Example Description}

First, an \emph{itkImage} $\big($dimension of $3$, size of $50x50x50$, spacing of $(1,1,1)$,
and origin $(0,0,0)$ $\big)$ is created and completely filled with pixels of intensity value
$128$. Then, \emph{itkFloodFilledSpatialFunctionConditionalIterator} is used to iterate
through the image and set pixels to 256 if
\emph{itkEllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunction} returns 1, meaning that it is within the
interior of the ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is defined by its axes lengths (from edge-to-edge
of the ellipsoid) as well as the orientations of these axes. This example is restricted to
3D to allow for the visualization of the resulting image, which is done via a \emph{VTK}
image. The volume of the ellipsoid is measured by counting the number of interior pixels of
the ellipsoid. This measure can be used to verify the resulting ellipsoid by comparing it
against the calculated volume (percent difference) of the ellipsoid given by:
\begin{equation}\label{1}
  V=\frac{4}{3} \pi \Big(\frac{a}{2}\Big) \Big(\frac{b}{2}\Big) \Big(\frac{c}{2}\Big),
\end{equation}
where a, b, and c are the lengths of the ellipsoid axes.

The ellipsoid is also validated by checking that the center of the ellipsoid has been
labeled as an interior pixel (a function value of 1) by evaluating the spatial function at
the origin of the ellipsoid.

NOTE: Orientation vectors must be orthogonal to each other!

\section{What is Needed to Run This Example?}

Build and run itkEllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunctionExample.cxx from the workspace
generated from CMake. The resulting VTK image file is stored as:

\begin{center}
"Insight/Examples/EllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunction/ellipsoid.vtk"
\end{center}

Default settings should result in an image of an ellipsoid with its axis of length 40
oriented along the (0,1,0) direction, axis of length 30 oriented along the (1,0,0)
direction, and axis of length 20 oriented along the (0,0,1) direction. The origin of the
ellipsoid is sampled and evaluated by the spatial function and returns \emph{function
value}, which is $1$ since the origin of the ellipsoid is within the ellipsoid.

\section{Insight Classes Used}

These are the Insight classes used for this example with a brief description. They appear in
order of first use:

\begin{itemize}
\item itkImage.h: generates a physical image.
\item itkImageRegionIterator.h: iterates through the pixels in the physical image and sets
them to $128$.
\item itkEllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunction.h: evaluates pixels in the image and determines whether they are within the ellipsoid or
not.
\item itkFloodFilledSpatialFunctionConditionalIterator.h: iterates the image and sets them to $256$ if they are within the
ellipsoid.
\end{itemize}

\section{Possible Uses Of Ellipsoids}
The ellipsoid images created by EllipsoidInteriorExteriorSpatialFunction are useful for
testing imaging algorithms, pixel sampling routines, establishing geometric domains of
influence, etc.

\section{Non-ITK Requirements}
A VTK image viewer is needed to visualize the output file ellipsoid.vtk.
