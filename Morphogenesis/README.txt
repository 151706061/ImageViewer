 This is an example of Morphogenesis simulation.

 Morphogenesis is the process responsible for generating shapes in living
 organisms. The understanding of Morphogenesis is important in medical image
 processing because it set up the basis for creating shape models of organs.

 Morphogenesis is acomplished by the most part during the first stages of
 formation of an embryo, and continues at a slower pace until the death of the
 organism.

 This program simulates some of the aspects involved in morphogenesis. For that
 itkMeshes are used to represent living cells interacting via adhesion and
 mechanical resistance, exchanging information via biochemical compounds,
 dividing by mitosis and eventually disapearing by programmed cell death.


 To build this program you will need the FLTK associated library, in the 
 Auxiliary/FltkImageViewer  directory.
