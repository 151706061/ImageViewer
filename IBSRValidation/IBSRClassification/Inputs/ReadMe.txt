This file shows the systax followed in the parameter files. 
The parameter files are needed for the Gaussian Classifier based applications and are generated
apriori manually.

#NumberOfClasses (number of tissue type + 1 for background)
0 1173 1255 1323 (each #corresponds to the mean of background, tissue type 1,2 and 3)
0 2156 1120 581  (each #corresponds to the variance of background, tissue type 1,2 and 3)
0 254 6979 3974 (each #corresponds to the number of samples of background, tissue type 1,2 and 3 in the model)
