 AtlasSegmentation:
 ==================

 This directory contains source code, input parameter files and ouput files
 for atlas-based segmentation validation study.

 The study evaluates the effectivenessof the ITK implementation of the
 "demons" based deformable registration algorithm [1] for the application
 of atlas-based segmentation of the whole brain volume from MR images.
