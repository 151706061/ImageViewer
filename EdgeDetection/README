You need to make change in CMakeLists.txt file to select one of the following
example.

1. itk3DEdgeDetectionSample.txx :

This is an example for edge detection for 3D images. 

Important: You need to define the macros in the Makefile to indicate which edge detector you want to use: zero-crossing edge detector, sobel detector, canny edge detector. 

ZEROCORSSING ---zerocrossing based edge detector
SOBEL    --- use sobel detector
CANNY    --- use canny edge detector

This example reads a VTK format raw image file, and writes output to VTK format image.


2. itk2DEdgeDetectionSample.txx

This is an example for edge detection for 2D images. 

Important: You need to define the macros in the Makefile to indicate which edge detector you want to use: zero-crossing based edge detector, sobel detector, canny edge detector. 

ZEROCORSSING ---zerocrossing based edge detector
SOBEL    --- use sobel detector
CANNY    --- use canny edge detector

This example reads a PGM ascii format raw image file, and writes output to ascii raw image format.
