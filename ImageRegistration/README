     Image Registration Application


WHAT IS THIS ?

This program is an example of a small 
application based on Insight.
It includes image display, GUI, and IO.

The program allows the user to load an 
image from a file, apply a known space
transformation to it, and then register
the result with the original image.


WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT ?

As GUI and visualization are not part of
Insight, external libraries are required
for this program. The GUI is implemented
using FLTK (the Fast Light Toolkit) that
can be freely downloaded from 
http://www.fltk.org.

FLTK is multiplatform and will run without
trouble on Linux, IRIX and Windows 95/NT 
and SunOS.

This program also require some of the 
code in the /Auxiliary directory, in 
particular the classes for read/write image
in MetaImage format, and the base classes
for display. This code is not built by 
default, so you should have to activate it.



HOW TO BUILD IT ?

Let's call "Insight" the directory in which 
you installed the toolkit.

To build this program you should follow
these steps 


1) Download and install FLTK

2) Activate the compilation of Auxiliary classes.
   When you run CMake set the option:

   BUILD_AUXILIARY = "ON"

3) Activate the compilation of Example programs.
   When you run CMake set the option:

   BUILD_EXAMPLES = "ON"

4) From CMake configure and generate the 
   configuration files: Project files for
   windows and Makefiles for Unix.


5) on Unix:

   run make

   on Windows:
  
   open the itk.dsw workspace file and select
   the ImageRegistration project. Rebuild it.


6) on Unix:
  
   The executable should be availabe at your Insight binary
   directory, under : /Examples/ImageRegistration/ImageRegistration

 
   on Windows:

   run the program from the Visual C++ environment.
   

7) Enjoy  !
