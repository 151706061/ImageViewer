     Image Registration Application


WHAT IS THIS ?

This program is an example of a small 
application based on Insight.
It includes image display, GUI, and IO.

The program allows the user to load an 
image from a file, apply a known space
transformation to it, and then register
the result with the original image.


WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT ?

As GUI and visualization are not part of
Insight, external libraries are required
for this program. The GUI is implemented
using FLTK (the Fast Light Toolkit) that
can be freely downloaded from 
http://www.fltk.org.

FLTK is multiplatform and will run without
trouble on Linux, IRIX and Windows 95/NT 
and SunOS.

This program also require some of the 
code in the /Unsupported directory, in 
particular the classes for read/write image
in MetaImage format, and the base classes
for display. This code is not built by 
default, so you should have to activate it.



HOW TO BUILD IT ?

Let's call "Insight" the directory in which 
you installed the toolkit.

To build this program you should follow
these steps 


1) Download and install FLTK

2) Activate the compilation of Unsupported
   classes.

2.1)  Go to  your Insight directory and edit
      the file CMakeList.txt. Look for the line
      containing the command "SUBDIRS"

      Add at the end of the list between the 
      parenthesis, the directories "Unsupported"
      and "Examples".
      
      the line will look similar to:

      "SUBDIRS(Utilities Code Testing Examples Unsupported)"

      (without the quotes...)

      That will indicate to the make program CMake that 
      this directories should be included in the building 
      process.

      If you want to know more about CMakeList
      files and the portable maker CMake, please
      consult:  Insight/Documents/CMake.pdf

2.2)  cd to Insight/Unsupported.
      edit the CMakeList.txt file.
      Look for the line containing the command
      "SUBDIRS". Add the directories "MetaImage"
      and "FltkImageViewer".
    
      The line will look similar to:
      
      "SUBDIRS(MetaImage FltkImageViewer)"

      (without the quotes...)

      MetaImage contains a set of classes for
      reading and writing images on files.
      
      FltkImageViewer contains classes for the 
      GUI of image display.


2.3)  cd to Insight/Unsupported/MetaImage.
      edit the CMakeList.txt file.
      Look for the line containing the command
      "SUBDIRS". Add the directory "IView".
    
      The line will look similar to:

      "SUBDIRS(IView)"

      (without the quotes...)

      IView is a set of classes for Image display.


3) Rerun "configure" (on Unix) or CMakeSetup (on windows)
   as you did the first time you installed the Insight
   toolkit.  That will regenerate the Makefiles (on Unix)
   or .dsw .dsp project files (on Windows for Visual C++).
  

4) on Unix:

   run make

   on Windows:
  
   open the itk.dsw workspace file and select
   the ImageRegistration project. Rebuild it.


5) on Unix:
  
   The executable should be availabe at your Insight binary
   directory, under : /Examples/ImageRegistration/ImageRegistration

 
   on Windows:

   run the program from the Visual C++ environment.
   

6) Enjoy  !
