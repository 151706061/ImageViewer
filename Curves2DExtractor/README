     2D Curves Extractor Application


WHAT IS THIS ?

This program is an example of a small 
application based on Insight.
It includes image display, GUI, and IO.

This program detects and extracts curves
from 2D images. The extraction method is
based on the computation of the Hessian
matrix.


WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT ?

As GUI and visualization are not part of
Insight, external libraries are required
for this program. The GUI is implemented
using FLTK (the Fast Light Toolkit) that
can be freely downloaded from 
http://www.fltk.org.

FLTK is multiplatform and will run without
trouble on Linux, IRIX and Windows 95/NT 
and SunOS.

This program also require some of the 
code in the /Unsupported directory, in 
particular the classes for read/write image
in MetaImage format, and the base classes
for display. This code is not built by 
default, so you should have to activate it.



We appreciate your feedback.
