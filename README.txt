Description of Directory Code/Interfaces/

This directory is meant for code that interfaces packages
to Insight. The interface code typically requires external
libraries, header files, or build processes. Therefore the
interface code is not part of the mainstream Insight build
process. To build Insight with one or more of these packages,
extra steps are usually required. Each sub-directory will have
a README file describing what extra steps are required.
